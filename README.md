# WorstBracketBingo

A very basic reverse-bracket app for playing bingo with any fantasy draft style tournament brackets to make picking losing teams more fun. You can create multiple bingo boards for each bracket for you and your friends to see who has the worst(best) picks. For each bracket, stats tracked include: first bingo, last bingo, total rounds alive for all entrants (per bingo board), first complete elimination (all board pieces eliminated), and the last entrants alive for the tournament (either winner or the last one(s) eliminated).

This app is still in the very early stages.
